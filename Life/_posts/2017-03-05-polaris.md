During my last trip to Anza Berrago, my wife and I ended up taking a cool astronomy class with [Dennis Mammana](http://www.dennismammana.com). Here's Dennis setting up his 14-inch Dobsonian telescope.

Once the sun sets, you get a treat because it gets REALLY dark (Dennis schudules nights when there's minimal moonlight). After going through some constellations using his laser pointer and our naked eye, we hope onto the telescope and start peering way WAY into the distance space and time. You see planets (Neptune, 2.7 billion miles away), a ring nebula (M57, 1,500 light years away), and even our neighboring galaxy (Andromeda, 2.4 million light years, not miles, LIGHT YEARS away). 

Of particular interest to me as Polaris, the North Star. Navigators of old used it because it's stationary in the sky. Remember how the earth rotates along an axis? Well, the stars don't "move" in the absoluate sense but we Earthlings rotate so to us, almost all the starts appear to move across the night sky, EXCEPT stars that are positioned right "above" that axis of rotation (like Polaris). It's hard to tell just staring at it, but if you take multiple pictures tens of minutes apart, a time lapse video, and stitch them together, it because pretty clear:
